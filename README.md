# Canadian Tire Bikes Web Scraper

This project is a comprehensive web scraping solution that extracts bicycle products and customer reviews from Canadian Tire using advanced Selenium WebDriver techniques. The scraper focuses specifically on bikes and cycling products, providing detailed product information, pricing data, and customer sentiment analysis.

## üéØ Project Overview

This scraper was designed to collect comprehensive data about bicycles sold on Canadian Tire's e-commerce platform. It extracts product listings, detailed specifications, customer reviews, and performs sentiment analysis to understand customer satisfaction patterns in the cycling market.

### Target Data
- **Product Focus**: Bicycles and cycling equipment exclusively
- **Search Scope**: Canadian Tire bikes search results
- **Data Depth**: Complete product catalog with reviews and ratings
- **Analysis**: Natural Language Processing and sentiment analysis on customer feedback

## üìã Features & Capabilities

- **üö¥ Bike-Specific Product Extraction**: Targets bicycle search results with comprehensive product data
- **‚≠ê Advanced Review Mining**: Extracts all customer reviews with automatic pagination handling
- **üì± Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works with both desktop and mobile Canadian Tire interfaces
- **üîó Complete Traceability**: Each review linked to its source product for data integrity
- **üí∞ Price & Discount Analysis**: Captures pricing, discounts, and promotional information
- **üìä Sentiment Analysis**: NLP-powered sentiment classification of customer reviews
- **üîÑ Resume Capability**: Can continue interrupted scraping sessions
- **‚ö° Parallel Processing**: Multi-threaded extraction for improved performance

## üß† Scraping Methodology

### 1. Search Strategy
- **Base URL**: `https://www.canadiantire.ca/en/search-results.html?q=bikes`
- **Approach**: Systematic extraction of all bike-related products from search results
- **Pagination**: Automatic handling of search result pagination to capture complete inventory

### 2. Product Discovery Process
```
Search Query: "bikes" ‚Üí Product Listings ‚Üí Individual Product Pages ‚Üí Review Sections
```

### 3. Data Extraction Layers

#### Layer 1: Product Catalog
- Product titles and descriptions
- Pricing information (current price, original price, discounts)
- Product URLs and unique identifiers
- Brand classification
- Category assignment (mountain bikes, comfort bikes, kids bikes, etc.)

#### Layer 2: Customer Reviews
- Individual review content and ratings
- Reviewer information and verification status
- Review dates and helpfulness scores
- Product-specific review aggregations

#### Layer 3: Sentiment & NLP Analysis
- Sentence tokenization of review text
- Word-level analysis for keyword extraction
- Sentiment classification (positive, negative, neutral)
- Confidence scoring for sentiment predictions

### 4. Technical Implementation

#### Browser Automation
- **Technology**: Selenium WebDriver with Chrome
- **Handling**: Dynamic content loading via JavaScript execution
- **Reliability**: Robust element waiting and error handling
- **Mobile Support**: Automatic detection and handling of mobile accordion interfaces

#### Review Extraction Specifics
```python
# Canadian Tire uses Bazaarvoice for reviews
# Our scraper handles their specific pagination system:
1. Click review count button ‚Üí Opens review section
2. Wait for dynamic content load ‚Üí Reviews container appears  
3. Extract visible reviews ‚Üí Parse individual review data
4. Navigate pagination ‚Üí "Next Reviews" button clicking
5. Repeat until all reviews collected
```

## üéØ Key Assumptions & Limitations

### Data Assumptions
1. **Search Scope**: Focuses exclusively on products returned by "bikes" search query
2. **Language**: Processes English and French reviews (Canadian bilingual content)
3. **Availability**: Only captures products currently listed and available
4. **Review Completeness**: Assumes all public reviews are accessible via pagination

### Technical Assumptions
1. **Site Structure**: Based on Canadian Tire's current DOM structure (as of 2025)
2. **Bazaarvoice Integration**: Relies on current review system implementation
3. **Rate Limiting**: Implements respectful delays to avoid triggering anti-bot measures

### Business Logic Assumptions
1. **Product Classification**: Categorizes products based on title keywords and descriptions
2. **Price Analysis**: Considers displayed prices as current market pricing
3. **Review Authenticity**: Treats all displayed reviews as legitimate customer feedback
4. **Seasonality**: Data represents point-in-time snapshot, not seasonal trends

- **Error Logging**: Comprehensive logging for debugging and monitoring

## üîß Configuration & Customization

### Performance Optimization
```python
# In review_scraper.py - Enable headless mode for faster processing
options.add_argument("--headless")

# Adjust pagination limits based on requirements
reviews = handle_review_pagination(driver, max_pages=5)  # Increase for more reviews

# Parallel processing for large datasets
python parallel_review_scraper.py  # Multi-threaded version
```

### MongoDB Configuration
```python
# Update connection string in NLP scripts
uri = "mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/..."

# Database and collection names
database: canadian_tire_scraper
collections: products, reviews
```

### Search Customization
```python
# Modify search terms in simple_scraper.py
search_url = "https://www.canadiantire.ca/en/search-results.html?q=bikes"
# Could be changed to: "mountain+bikes", "kids+bikes", etc.
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

#### 1. ChromeDriver Compatibility
```bash
# Update ChromeDriver
pip install --upgrade webdriver-manager
```

#### 2. Review Loading Timeouts
```python
# Increase timeout in wait_for_reviews_section_to_load()
def wait_for_reviews_section_to_load(driver, timeout=60):  # Increase from 30
```

#### 3. Bazaarvoice Element Changes
If Canadian Tire updates their review system:
- Check CSS selectors in `click_on_review_count()`
- Update pagination selectors in `handle_review_pagination()`
- Verify review container IDs in `extract_individual_reviews()`

#### 4. MongoDB Connection Issues
```bash
# Check network connectivity and credentials
# Verify cluster whitelist includes your IP
# Confirm database permissions
```

### Performance Monitoring
```python
# Track extraction metrics
print(f"Products extracted: {len(products)}")
print(f"Reviews per minute: {reviews_count / elapsed_minutes}")
print(f"Success rate: {successful_extractions / total_attempts * 100}%")
```
